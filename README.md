Morse Code
 What is Morse Code?
Morse code is a system that uses **dots (.) and dashes (-)** to represent letters, numbers, and punctuation.  
It is a way to send messages using light, sound, or electrical signals.

History of Morse Code
Morse code was created in the **1830s** by **Samuel Morse** and **Alfred Vail** to be used with the **telegraph system**.  
It was the first method of sending messages over long distances without having to carry them physically.  

Morse code became very important during **wars and emergencies**, especially for the **military and ships**,  
because it could be sent using simple signals like tapping, light flashes, or beeping sounds.

 How Does It Work?
Each letter or number is changed into a **code made of dots and dashes**:
- A **dot (.)** is a short signal.
- A **dash (-)** is a long signal.

The timing is also important:
- A short pause separates each letter.
- A longer pause separates each word.

Morse Code Examples
- A = `.-`  
- B = `-...`  
- C = `-.-.`  
- 1 = `.----`  
- 2 = `..---`

 Examples of Words in Morse Code
- **HELLO** = `.... . .-.. .-.. ---`  
- **CODE** = `-.-. --- -.. .`  
- **HELP** = `.... . .-.. .--.`
